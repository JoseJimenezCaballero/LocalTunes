# Local Tunes

**Local Tunes** is a web application designed to help users discover new music artists based on their geographic location. By integrating data from the MusicBrainz API, the app identifies artists in a user's city, state, or country and then uses the Spotify API to fetch their top tracks. The front end of the application is built with React, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience, with smooth animations powered by Framer Motion. The application is deployed with the front end hosted on Netlify and the back end on Render, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.
